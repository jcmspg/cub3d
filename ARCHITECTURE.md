## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

The Cub3D engine is built on several key architectural principles:

1. **Deterministic Behavior**: Fixed-point arithmetic ensures identical results across different hardware platforms
2. **Performance Optimization**: Lookup tables and efficient algorithms minimize computational overhead
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Smart data structures reduce memory footprint while maintaining functionality
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between game logic, mathematical operations, and rendering
5. **Scalability**: Resolution-independent design allows adaptation to any screen size

### Why These Choices?

**Fixed-Point Over Floating-Point:**
- Eliminates precision errors in collision detection
- Provides consistent behavior across different CPUs/FPUs
- Enables deterministic gameplay for testing and debugging
- Aligns perfectly with integer-based map collision system

**Lookup Tables Over Runtime Calculation:**
- O(1) trigonometric operations instead of expensive `sin()/cos()` calls
- 75% memory reduction through quadrant symmetry exploitation
- Cache-friendly data access patterns
- Predictable performance characteristics

## Mathematical Foundations

### Fixed-Point Precision Analysis

The poormanfixedpoint library uses 16.16 fixed-point format:

```
32-bit integer: IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII.FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
                â†‘ 16 bits integer â†‘ 16 bits fractional
```

**Precision Characteristics:**
- **Range**: -32,768.0 to 32,767.999984741
- **Precision**: 1/65,536 â‰ˆ 0.0000152587890625
- **Suitable for**: World coordinates up to Â±32K units with sub-pixel precision

**Comparison with float:**
```c
// Float precision varies with magnitude
float f1 = 1.0f + 0.0000001f;  // May lose precision
float f2 = 1000.0f + 0.001f;   // Definitely loses precision

// Fixed-point precision is constant
t_fixed32 fx1 = to_fixed32(1.0f) + to_fixed32(0.0000153f);     // Preserved
t_fixed32 fx2 = to_fixed32(1000.0f) + to_fixed32(0.0000153f);  // Preserved
```

### Trigonometric Accuracy Analysis

**Standard Library vs Lookup Table:**

| Method | Accuracy | Performance | Memory |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `sinf()` | ~7 decimal places | ~100 cycles | 0 bytes |
| Lookup 360Â° | Exact at degrees | ~5 cycles | 2,880 bytes |
| Lookup 90Â° + quad | Exact at degrees | ~8 cycles | 728 bytes |

**Error Analysis:**
```c
// Maximum error occurs between table entries
// For 1-degree resolution: max error â‰ˆ 0.0003 radians
// This translates to < 0.02% error in distance calculations
// Well within acceptable limits for pixel-level rendering
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Theoretical Performance Gains

**Trigonometric Operations:**
- Standard: `sin(x)` â‰ˆ 100-300 CPU cycles
- Lookup: `table[x]` â‰ˆ 1-5 CPU cycles
- **Speedup**: 20-300x faster

**Memory Access Patterns:**
- Sequential table access: Cache-friendly
- Random texture access: Optimized for MLX buffer layout
- Map array access: Predictable stride patterns

**Frame Rate Projections:**
```
Target: 60 FPS = 16.67ms per frame
Screen width: 800 pixels
Rays per frame: 800
Time per ray: 20.8Î¼s budget

With lookup tables: ~2Î¼s per ray
Safety margin: 10x performance headroom
```

## Testing and Validation Strategy

```c
// Test fixed-point precision boundaries
assert(to_fixed32(1.0f) + to_fixed32(0.0000153f) > to_fixed32(1.0f));

// Test trigonometric table accuracy
for (int deg = 0; deg < 360; deg++) {
    float expected = sinf(deg * M_PI / 180.0f);
    float actual = from_fixed32(fast_sin(&trig, deg));
    assert(fabs(expected - actual) < 0.001f);
}
```

**Performance Validation:**
```c
// Benchmark ray casting performance
uint64_t start = get_time_microseconds();
for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
    cast_single_ray(data, to_fixed32((float)i));
}
uint64_t duration = get_time_microseconds() - start;
assert(duration < 100000);  // Must complete in < 100ms
```

**Memory Safety:**
```c
// Valgrind integration for automated memory testing
// Static analysis for buffer overflow detection
// Stress testing with large maps and long sessions
```
